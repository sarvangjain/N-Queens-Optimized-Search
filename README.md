# N-Queens-Optimized-Search
This project implements optimized versions of BFS, DFS and Simulated Annealing for a N-Queens like problem.
The problem is similar to N-queens and uses the concept of Lizards instead of Queens, with a catch, some cases might have trees which can prevent the Lizards from attacking each other. The detailed project description is a below:-

You are a zookeeper in the reptile house. One of your rare South Pacific Tufted Wizzo lizards
(Tufticus Wizzocus) has just had several babies. Your job is to find a place to put each baby lizard
in a nursery.
However, there is a catch, the baby lizards have very long tongues. A baby lizard can shoot out
its tongue and eat any other baby lizard before you have time to save it. As such, you want to
make sure that no baby lizard can eat another baby lizard in the nursery (burp).
For each baby lizard, you can place them in one spot on a grid. From there, they can shoot out
their tongue up, down, left, right and diagonally as well. Their tongues are very long and can
reach to the edge of the nursery from any location.

In addition to baby lizards, your nursery may have some trees planted in it. Your lizards cannot
shoot their tongues through the trees nor can you move a lizard into the same place as a tree. As
such, a tree will block any lizard from eating another lizard if it is in the path. Additionally, the
tree will block you from moving the lizard to that location.

Input: The file input.txt in the current directory of your program will be formatted as follows:
First line: instruction of which algorithm to use: BFS, DFS or SA
Second line: strictly positive 32-bit integer n, the width and height of the square nursery
Third line: strictly positive 32-bit integer p, the number of baby lizards
Next n lines: the n x n nursery, one file line per nursery row (to show you where the trees are).
It will have a 0 where there is nothing, and a 2 where there is a tree.
So for instance, an input file arranged (but with no lizards yet) and requesting you
to use the DFS algorithm to place 8 lizards in the 8x8 nursery would look like:
DFS
8
8
00000000
00000000
00000000
00002000
00000000
00000200
00000000
00000000

Output: The file output.txt which your program creates in the current directory should be
formatted as follows:
First line: OK or FAIL, indicating whether a solution was found or not.
If FAIL, any following lines are ignored.
Next n lines: the n x n nursery, one line in the file per nursery row, including the baby lizards
and trees. It will have a 0 where there is nothing, a 1 where you placed a baby
lizard, and a 2 where there is a tree.
For example, a correct output.txt for the above sample input.txt is:

OK
00000100
10000000
00001000
01002001
00000000
00100200
00000010
00010000
